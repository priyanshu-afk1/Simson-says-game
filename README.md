# Simon Says Game 🎮

Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive memory-based game where players need to follow and remember an increasingly challenging sequence of button flashes. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is inspired by the classic electronic game, Simon.

# 📝 Description

In this game, a sequence of colored buttons lights up, and the player has to repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order. With each correct sequence, the level increases, adding an additional step to the sequence and making it more challenging to remember.

# How it works:

When the game starts, the program generates a random sequence of button colors.
Each round, a new color is added to the sequence.
The player’s goal is to repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the same order.
If the player repeats the sequence correctly, they advance to the next level.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they are prompted to restart.

# 🔥 Features

Dynamic Leveling: The game gets harder with each level as the sequence grows longer.
Interactive Button Feedback: The buttons light up when clicked to provide visual feedback to the player.
Game Over Animation: The background briefly flashes red to signal a mistake, adding to the excitement.
Score Display: The game shows the current level as the score, so players can track their progress.
